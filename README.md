## DEATH SWAP

Every 5 minutes, you're randomly swapped with someone on the map. Your goal is to set-up traps and figure out ways to kill your opponents without direct PvP. The last player standing wins. As the game progresses, the interval's timer will gradually decrease - upping the intensity to find out who the winner is.
